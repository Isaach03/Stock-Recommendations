# Stock-Recommendations

This is a program which scrapes information from Investing.com about UK stocks, displays information about each stock and gives a recommendation on which stocks to buy. The program uses the relative strength index, 20 day moving average, highs/lows indicator and volume to give recommendations.

This project uses Python and HTML. BeautifulSoup and lxml were used for the webscraping. Flask was used to locally host the website in the browser.
